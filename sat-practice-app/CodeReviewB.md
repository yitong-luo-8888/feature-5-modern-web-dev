## Reviewer Comments by Yitong Luo

âœ… All API calls are abstracted cleanly into `AuthService.js`.  
âœ… Login and Register components are functional and responsive.  
âœ… Error handling works well, especially for Parse 401 errors.  
âœ… User dashboard displays the expected user fields post-login.

ðŸ›  Suggestion: Add loading state indicators on async form submissions to improve UX.
